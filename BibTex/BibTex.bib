We use prices from the grey market (the when-issued market that precedes European IPOs) to proxy for small investors’ valuations. High grey market prices (indicating overoptimism) are a very good predictor of first-day aftermarket prices, while low grey market prices (indicating excessive pessimism) are not. Moreover, we find long-run price reversal only following high grey market prices. This asymmetry occurs because larger (institutional) investors can choose between keeping the shares they are allocated in the IPO, and reselling them when small investors are overoptimistic.},

	abstract = {This research looks at the predictive capability of social networks, e.g. Twitter, focusing on the financial community and the stock market. The goal of this study is to predict the stock price of companies that have offered IPOs. This is performed through the analysis of Twitter messages and the differences between the sentiment analyses of 8 algorithms applied to study Twitter sentences regarding the financial market. The above referred algorithms differ in the way tweets are selected, the community is chosen and events are detected through Twitter. In order to optimize results a genetic algorithm solution is considered with the purpose of determining the weights of the applied indicators to each sentiment algorithm. The proposed approach, lead to returns of 59\% during the first negotiation days, and of 72\% a week},

	abstract = {Companies issuing stocks through an initial public offering (IPO) are obligated to publish relevant information as part of a prospectus. Besides quantitative ﬁgures from accounting, this document also contains qualitative information in the form of text. In this chapter, we analyze how sentiment in the prospectus inﬂuences future stock returns. In addition, we investigate the impact of preIPO sentiment in ﬁnancial announcements on ﬁrst-day returns. The results of our empirical analyses using 572 IPOs from US companies suggest a negative link between words linked to uncertainty and future stock market returns for up to 10 trading days. Conversely, we ﬁnd that uncertainty expressed in pre-IPO announcements is positively linked to ﬁrst-day stock returns. These insights have implications for research on IPOs by demonstrating that future stock returns are also driven by textual information from the prospectus and assist investors in placing their orders.},
